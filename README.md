# Winforms Designer Extension

This project adds option to open cs form file (file.Designer.cs) in winforms editor. Editor used is opensourced, you can find it here: https://github.com/hry2566/SWD4CS

## Installation

I included a compiled version of swd4cs in repo. you just need to put that folder under %appdata%\vscode (or %appdata%\vscodium) then install the extension.

## Usage

There are 2 uses for this:

First is that you can open command palette(ctrl+shift+p) and select "Winforms: Open Designer", this will open designer without a file in it and you have to select it yourself.

Second is that you right-click the file and select "Winforms: Open file in designer", that will open a new window woth designer.

## Thank You for considering my extension
